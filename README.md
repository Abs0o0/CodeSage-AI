##  Project Overview
- CodeSage AI is a centralized web platform that allows developers and teams to **upload JavaScript or TypeScript** code snippets and **receive AI-powered feedback** on code style, design patterns, best practices, and documentation quality.

- The platform solves the problem of inconsistent code quality and lack of proper documentation in collaborative development environments. Instead of manually reviewing every snippet, developers can receive instant AI-driven analysis including:

   1. Code style improvements

   2. Refactoring suggestions

   3. Best practice validation

   4. Automated documentation generation

   5. Unit test generation

>**The system will be presented as a fully functional web application with secure authentication, interactive UI visualizations, and AI-generated reports.**

---

## Project Objectives
- **Build a secure web-based platform for uploading and reviewing code snippets**

- **Integrate AI to analyze JavaScript/TypeScript code quality**

- **Automatically generate functional documentation and unit tests**

- **Visualize code structure using interactive graphical components**

- **Implement authentication and authorization using JWT**

---

##  Project Scope
- User Registration & Login system (JWT-based authentication)

- Upload JavaScript/TypeScript code snippets

- AI-based code analysis & suggestions

- Automatic documentation generation

- Unit test generation (Jest format)

- Code structure visualization using SVG/Canvas

- Secure API with middleware protection

- Dashboard for viewing review history  

>  **Final Deliverable:** [A fully deployed web application built with React and Node.js that allows authenticated users to upload code, receive AI-driven feedback, visualize structure, and export generated documentation and unit tests.]
